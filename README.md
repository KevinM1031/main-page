# Main Page

A personal website
Visit the [website](https://kevinm1031.github.io).

This website is more of a personal archive/exhibition than anything else, but can serve as a professional website to some degree as well.  
The deeper you scroll down, the more "eccentric" things get.

#### Web link parameters
- `p` sets the page number. Defaults to `p=1`.
- `b` sets the initial page view. `b=true` opens the page where its contents are visible, and `b=false` opens the page at the very top. Defaults to `b=false`.
- `lang` sets the language. Possible options are `eng` (English) and `kor` (Korean). Defaults to `lang=eng`.

*Example:* `https://kevinm1031.github.io/main-page/?p=2&b=true&lang=kor` *shows the contents section of page 2 in Korean.*
